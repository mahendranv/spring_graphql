# Spring Boot with GraphQL 



## Intro

GraphQL is an alternative for traditional REST APIs. To put in simple words, **Through a single endpoint, you can access the required resources at the client end**, and communication is defined in terms of GraphQL mutations & queries. GraphQL is not related to db, it is a query language for APIs.



Refer https://graphql.org/ for the usage.



## Components

1. Spring Boot for server side application
2. MySQL to store data
3. GraphQL to expose the resources
